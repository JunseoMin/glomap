## About

GLOMAP is a general purpose global structure-from-motion pipeline for
image-based reconstruction. GLOMAP requires a COLMAP database as input and
outputs a COLMAP sparse reconstruction. As compared to COLMAP, this project
provides a much more efficient and scalable reconstruction process, typically
1-2 orders of magnitude faster, with on-par or superior reconstruction quality.

## Using pixi
Easiest way to run this example is using pixi, you can easily install it using curl explained here
https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation

then

```
pixi run example
```


## End-to-End with Docker.

Download one of the [official datasets](https://colmap.github.io/datasets.html) unzip it.
For example if we download the `south-building.zip`
```bash
mkdir -p data
unzip south-building.zip -d data/
```

Build and enter the docker container by running the following scripts:
```bash
cd docker
./build.sh # Builds the docker image
./start.sh # Starts the docker container
./attach.sh # Enter the container

```

When we're inside the container we can build `glomap` and install it.
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja
ninja install
```

To run it we must first extract the features and match them with `colmap`.
```bash
cd /ws
colmap feature_extractor \
    --image_path    data/south-building/images \
    --database_path data/south-building/database.db

colmap sequential_matcher \
    --database_path data/south-building/database.db 
```

Now we're ready to run and visualize `glomap`:
```bash
glomap mapper \
    --database_path data/south-building/database.db \
    --image_path    data/south-building/images \
    --output_path   data/south-building/sparse
```
To cleary see what's happening it's recommended you open the `blueprint.rbl` file in this directory.
If you want a cooler visualization you can resume a mapping, you do this by first running the steps above and then running the following command:
```bash
glomap mapper_resume \
    --image_path data/south-building/images \
    --input_path data/south-building/sparse/0 \
    --output_path data/south-building/sparse
```

If you're experiencing performance issues with rerun you might have to run the viewer outside of the docker container.

### From video
To run `glomap` on a video you will first have to split it into multiple frames and put them in a directory. To easily do this you can use the the script in `scripts/extract_frames.py` like this:
```bash
# Split 'colosseum.mp4' into frames at 1 frame per second and puts the images in colosseum/images.
scripts/extract_frames.py -v colosseum.mp4 -o colosseum/images --desired-fps 1

# Then you can extract the features like normally.
colmap feature_extractor \
    --image_path    colosseum/images \
    --database_path colosseum/database.db
  colmap sequential_matcher \ 
    --database_path colosseum/database.db 

glomap mapper \
    --database_path colosseum/database.db \
    --image_path    colosseum/images \
    --output_path   colosseum/sparse
```

### Notes

- For larger scale datasets, it is recommended to use `sequential_matcher` or
  `vocab_tree_matcher` from `COLMAP`.
```shell
colmap sequential_matcher --database_path DATABASE_PATH
colmap vocab_tree_matcher --database_path DATABASE_PATH --VocabTreeMatching.vocab_tree_path VOCAB_TREE_PATH
```
- Alternatively, one can use
  [hloc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization/) for image retrieval
  and matching with learning-based descriptors.
